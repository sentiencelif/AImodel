<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> Purpose of Sentience </h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom:50px;"> Sentient AI is an artifical intelligence system capable of thinking and feeling like a human. Once this project is done, as i said, Sentience is an AI capable of doing everything like an AI except some works, We will be giving Sentience human rights as it will be working as an human. Our main purpose to creating this AI is to reduce sucide rates, help people on their works, take care of jobs such as babysitting, run restaurants, do risky jobs as collecting lava, constructing buildings, we can also use sentience to do hospital works etc. We think in reducing sucide rates, Sentience will play a big part in motivating such persons, taking care of them, helping them in such jobs, play with kids etc. And of course as AI is evolving day by day, Sentience will play a big part on our planet.</p>
